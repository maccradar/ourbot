Suppose we have 3 agents


         inR|-------|outR     inR|-------|outR     inR|-------|outR
----------->|   1   |----------->|   2   |----------->|   3   |----------->
<-----------|       |<-----------|       |<-----------|       |<-----------
        outL|-------|inL     outL|-------|inL     outL|-------|inL

R: right going signals
L: left going signals

Defining neighbour list in system.cpf:
  - first neighbour is the one on the right
  - second neighbour is the one on the left

In this case:
  - agent 1: {2, 3}
  - agent 2: {3, 1}
  - agent 3: {1, 2}

If only 2 agents are connected:
  - agent 1: {2}
  - agent 2: {1}

agent 1 receives data on its inL, sent by 2 on its outL
agent 2 receives data on its inL, sent by 1 on its outR

the R-channels are not used
