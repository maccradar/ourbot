to do
-----

short-term
----------
- calibrate see3cam
+ test emperor side
    + fine calibration?
- problem with kurt
    - reinstall project eagle
- test ourbot side
    + problem with marker injection in Kalman
    + test obstacles
    - test flexonomy
        - remeasure distance from markers to table center
- test with 1 remote eagle
- test with 2 remote eagles
    - test merging
- 2 robots close to each other not detected well
+ only put on port when new marker/diff time (to verify)

- target should be communicated to camera
    - not correct -> solve in Visualizer
- visualizer component in project eagle
- position of robot should be given
- flexonomy
    - test with marcus 2
