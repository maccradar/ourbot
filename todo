short-term
----------
- calibrate see3cam
+ test emperor side
    + fine calibration?
- test ourbot side
    - conversion from unsigned long time to double (to test)
    - test nothing detected
    - test obstacles
    - test flexonomy
- test with 1 remote eagle
    - eagle shout communicate even if nothing was detected
- test with 2 remote eagles
    - test merge_obstacles

- if nothing received, last one plotted
- target should be communicated to camera
    - not correct -> solve in Visualizer
- visualizer component in project eagle
- position of robot should be given
- flexonomy
    - test with marcus 2
