todo flexonomy demo
-------------------

+ test/check correct marker positions
    + influence on orientation estimate?
    + need to retune estimator?
+ reduce orientation gain (reduced to 0.5)
+ reduce orientation threshold (reduced to 0.07)
+ test autorecover
    + not in 'reject'-mode
+ crash when infeasible homing
- test motion time
- why is kurt sending its trajectory? -> bug
- enlarge soft constraint
