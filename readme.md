# Welcome to the ourbot repository!

The ourbot is a mobile robotic platform which is designed, constructed and programmed by some guys of the [MECO research team](https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/pma/research/meco) of the Mechanical department at KU Leuven. Currently three ourbots are built. The purpose of the setup is the validation of (distributed) motion planning algorithms which are developed within the MECO group.

More information on the setup can be found on our [ourbot wiki](https://gitlab.mech.kuleuven.be/meco-setups/ourbot/wikis/home).
Any questions can be asked to the developers: Ruben, Maarten and Tim or can be posted on our mailinglist ourBot@ls.kuleuven.be.

We would like to thank some people who contributed to this project in some sense (ideas, testing, construction, fablab support, nailpolish, ...): Goele, Jan, Erik, Eline, Eddy, Bertram, Jean-Pierre, Jens, Simon, Michiel.
